# Mini-Notes
A simple notes management web application built as part of Jeffrey Way’s PHP for Beginners series on Laracasts.  This project demonstrates the core concepts of PHP, including routing, form handling, validation, and database using PDO. It’s built from scratch without frameworks to strengthen your understanding of how PHP works behind the scenes.
